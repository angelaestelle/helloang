        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          People play games to have fun. In order for a game to be playable,
          there's a number of important benchmarks it needs to meet. In order
          for a game to be equally playable by every demographic, there are even
          more benchmarks that need to be met. Across many factors, such as
          budget, planning, timing, priority, these don't always get met. Often
          times there are marks missed and are left by the community to publicly
          identify on their own, in hopes for an update or a better version on
          future releases.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm taking it upon myself to identify some of these missed marks from
          the lens of a UX/UI designer that plays video games all the time. In
          this case, I'll be analyzing and breaking down some of the usability
          misses of my favourite MMORPG

          by Square Enix. I will be measuring each problem
          and recommendation across accessibility and design principles using
          the unmoderated testing method (well, I guess I would also be the
          moderator).

        <h2>Final Fantasy XIV Online</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/">Square Enix</a> is a video game and entertainment company out of Japan known for the Final Fantasy franchise, Death Stranding, Marvel’s Avengers, Kingdom Hearts, and more.

Final Fantasy XIV Online is an MMORPG that requires you to 
create a character you can customize based on their physical 
appearance, race, class, and region of birth. It’s massively popular for dungeon raids 
and a plot rich with stories. You fight monsters with classic sword/axe/lance weaponry or 
with magic and complete quests. There are several expansions for the game that extend 
the main storyline.

    <!-- WHY IS USABILITY IMPORTANT -->
    <div class="project-wrapper">
      <div class="grid-container-100">
        <div class="full-row">
          <h2>What is usability and why is it important?</h2>
          <p>
            Usability is a simple foundational concept of design, yet so
            commonly it gets left out or implemented in portions. Usability is
            how somebody can accomplish a given task or goal in your product
            with maximum efficacy and ease. Good usability is guided by
            intentional research and user tests, with one goal in mind: to make
            this product easy to use as possible for the intended user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ease of use can be a major game—changer when it comes to putting a
            product ahead of the competition. If somebody learns the RPG game
            they are playing doesn't have a helpful map legend or colours to
            differentiate important elements, there are several other RPGs that
            do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having usability shortcomings — which, commonly, are intentional —
            can be a serious risk as it reduces the fun the user intended to
            experience. This gives them more of a reason to turn the game off
            and invest their attention elsewhere. Typically if the user is
            sensitive to usability, this leaves a lasting impression and they'll
            know to share with others how frustrating the product is. Not good.

              <h3>Rating</h3>
              <strong>High</strong> — this can be an awful experience when you play on a small or really large screen but the elements start to become pixelated. Can be an issue for those with visual impairment.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            You cannot adjust most UI - except for the chat box. You are able to adjust some UI using the HUD Layout screen, but you can start to see as the size goes up, the resolution goes down. This is probably something they had to hold back for the console players. This can be frustrating with smaller or extra large screens, for those with vision impairment, or when you need multiple windows open just because this is an MMO so its loaded with information for regular gameplay.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            <h3>Recommendation</h3>
            For the HUD layout screen, rather than using CTRL + Home (which is also not clear at ALL that this is an option, you have to look it up), perhaps introduce a slider, with high reso visuals, rather than limiting the size options to 5 sizes. The adjustment will be more fluid and can help those with varied needs. The HUD layout screen itself is not the most intuitive and makes more sense to intermediate-advanced FFXIV players.

          <div class="right">
            <h3>Rating</h3>
            <strong>Low</strong> — This is a heuristic issue. You have to keep selecting your mount function to get back on your mount. There is no value in getting off your mount in order to speak with NPCs. For me, this makes the game feel less immersive because it doesn't make sense.

          <h3>Description</h3>
          Using a mount is amazing because it helps you get to places faster. However, in order to speak with NPCs, you are unmounted once you interact with them and will have to re-mount after the interaction. You cannot start certain quests while mounted, either. I read in previous versions you had to manually unmount, so it seems like they have been working on this. On the other hand, the case could be they don't want a dozen Chocobos covering an NPC... but that doesn’t really happen.        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <h3>Recommendation</h3>
          Make automatic unmounting for cut scenes or battles, but keep everyone mounted for NPC interactions.         </div>

      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <div class="full-row">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This game easily is one of the most usable and accessible games I've played. There are visual cues for just about everything. You can adjust the font sizes for the entire game, including the chat log, and adjust the character lighting and the size of the cursor. Everything! Except most of the HUD window sizes. During combat the game uses target lock, so you don't have to manually button-mash your enemy. The game has a really wide camera zoom range, and you can easily rotate your angle a full 360 degrees on all sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          There aren't many obvious hindrances on the PC gameplay, the most obvious one being resizing the width and height of the UI, but I assume these limitations on resizing were made to accommodate for PS gamers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The game also has plenty of non-visual cues. There are sounds for nearly everything - mounting, skills, character/monster/object selection, system buttons, etc. The music changes when you are mounted/unmounted, and when you enter certain public quest areas known as FATEs. You are also able to customize your macros. Great work FFXIV!        </p>
