                    BestBuy Canada (2018/2019)
                </h1>
                <p>
                    During my short and exciting time at Best Buy Canada, I worked as an Experience Designer on the
                    eCommerce focusing on computing, imagine, and mobile products. We shipped new and improved weekly
                    experiences for customers with the help of business specialists, copywriters, UX designers, and
                    regular weekly meetings with all the digital designers at Best Buy. We worked on major product
                    launches for Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, and more. A big challenge we had during my time at Best Buy
                    involved improving the Best Buy Mobile section.
                    <br><br>
                    As customers landed on the BBM page, they would be overwhelmed with options and promotions resulting
                    in a high bounce rate and the many promotions, products, and new offers ignored. This was becoming a
                    major issue as copy and promotion were no longer helping create conversion but rather building a
                    bigger barrier with our customers. We spent some time with stakeholders and other team members to
                    identify this problem, our KPI’s, and worked together to create wireframes that would eventually
                    become the solution.
                    <br><br>
                    The solution became a new, efficient, clean redesign. The BBM page now having narrowed, simpler
                    navigation, no more promo overwhelm, allowing our customers to have the space, tools, and
                    opportunity to shop for the many great offers and products suitable for their needs.
                    <br><br>
                    The team and the customers were very happy with the new redesign. There was an <b>increase in
                        traffic
                        by 29%</b> and the <b>bounce rate dropped by 63%</b>. The customers showed they understood the
                    purpose of the
                    BBM section in a shorter amount of time, and we were able to see customers navigate into the
                    sub-categories which in turn created higher conversion for the BBM category.
