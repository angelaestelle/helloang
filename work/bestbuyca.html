                    BestBuy Canada (2018/2019)
                </h1>
            </div>
            <p>
                During my short and exciting time at Best Buy Canada, I worked as an Experience Designer on the
                eCommerce focusing on computing, imaging, and mobile products. We shipped new and improved weekly
                experiences for customers with the help of business specialists, copywriters, UX designers, and
                regular weekly meetings with all the digital designers at Best Buy. We worked on major product
                launches for Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, and more. A big challenge we had during my time at Best Buy
                involved improving the Best Buy Mobile section.
                <br><br>
                As customers landed on the BBM page, they would be overwhelmed with options and promotions resulting
                in a high bounce rate and the many promotions, products, and new offers ignored. This was becoming a
                major issue as copy and promotion were no longer helping create conversion but rather building a
                bigger barrier with our customers. We spent some time with stakeholders and other team members to
                identify this problem, our KPIâ€™s, and worked together to create wireframes that would eventually
                become the solution.</p>

            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>The solution became a new, efficient, clean redesign. The BBM page now having narrowed, simpler
                navigation, no more promo overwhelm, allowing our customers to have the space, tools, and
                opportunity to shop for the many great offers and products suitable for their needs.
                <br><br>
                The team and the customers were very happy with the new redesign. There was an <b>increase in
                    traffic by 29%</b> and the <b>bounce rate dropped by 63%</b>. The customers showed they
                understood the
                purpose of the
                BBM section in a shorter amount of time, and we were able to see customers navigate into the
                sub-categories which in turn created higher conversion for the BBM category.
