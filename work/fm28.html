                <p>
                    Celina reached out to me in the summer of 2019 with her idea of creating an artist collective based
                    out of LA, operating globally. She wanted to curate a collective of multifaceted artists and
                    entrepreneurs. This site is meant as a vessel for those interested in joining and repping the
                    community.
                    <br><br>
                    We went with SquareSpace as a CMS as it was simple to integrate forms, third party API’s, updating
                    content blocks, and injecting custom CSS. We worked together back-and-forth on several layout
                    options – we went with what we currently have as the colour scheme, black & white background gifs of
                    riots, and early 2000’s spam windows as it aligned with the look and feel of cyber-artsy apocalyptic
                    propaganda FM28 wanted to emulate.
                    <br><br>
                    Every page also had to feel like it had its own personality, since the site is very simple with
                    little information, so adding all types of visuals were instrumental for the project.
                    <br><br>
                    All of the assets were designed by myself, with exception of the VHS and riot videos. All moving
                    images on the site are GIFs as they perform faster and run upon page load.
