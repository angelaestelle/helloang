                </h1>
                <p>
                    Celina reached out to me in the summer of 2019 with her idea of creating an artist collective based
                    out of LA, operating globally. She wanted to curate a collective of multifaceted artists and
                    entrepreneurs. This site is meant as a vessel for those interested in joining and representing <a
                        href="https://www.fm28.co/" class="underline-2">the FM28
                        community.</a></p>
                <p>
                    <b>Sketches & Wireframes</b>
                    <br><br>
                    The information on this site is contained and minimal, so the design had to reflect that while using
                    visuals to fill up the space. The landing page was pretty straight forward – navigation, logo,
                    footer... however for the integral pages such as Submissions and Street Team, I was able to explore
                    a few options. I also had to keep asking myself, how many images is too many? Does that become a
                    barrier for the user when they fill out forms? Is that even useful for people? Given the site was
                    very limited in info and assets, I had to improvise.
                    <br><br>
                    What made it fun is that each page was encouraged to have its own differences such as visual
                    composition, the type of media used, and the way images looked. For the Street Team page, I wanted
                    to
                    involve something humanly yet anarchic (not pop-up windows!), high energy, and rebellious, which is
                    why we ended up going
                    with a black & white video background of a riot.

                    <p><b>SquareSpace as the CMS</b>
                        <br><br>
                        We went with SquareSpace as a CMS as it was simple to integrate forms, third party API’s,
                        updating
                        content blocks, and injecting custom CSS. We worked together back-and-forth on several layout
                        options – we went with what we currently have as the colour scheme, a high energy video of a
                        riot
                        from Ukraine, and early 2000’s spam windows as it aligned with the look and feel of cyber-artsy
                        apocalyptic
                        propaganda FM28 wanted to embrace. We also recognized we didn't want to basically image-vomit on
                        our
                        users unless it actually were helpful. For this project, it is entirely decorative and meant to
                        close up
                        any extra space.</p>

                        All kinds of visuals were instrumental for the site. Throughout the course our
                        dialogue had evolved from "use as many images as possible!" to "let's keep it minimum so
                        it doesn't overwhelm people."</p>

                    <p>All of the assets were designed by myself, with exception of the riot video on the Street Team
                        page. All moving images on the site are GIFs as they perform faster, easier to loop, and run
                        upon page load.
