                CCNC–SJ is the Chinese Canadian National Council – for Social Justice. The CCNC-SJ organization
                serves to educate, provide awareness, and tools on anti-Asian racism, specifically racism fueled by
                COVID-19. They work to engage and advocate for racial justice in Canada.
                <br><br>
                I was tasked to help deliver an improved update of their current website. Improvements including
                visual identity, accessibility, consistency, and recall. Also to make room for upcoming content
                including the history of anti-racist resilience of the Asian community, and an educational toolkit
                provided by teachers who were hired as consultants meant to help people respond effectively to
                racism.

                <b>Reorganize to optimize goals</b>
                <br><br>
                During the initial stages I focused on reorganizing the order of content on the website. It began
                with focusing on user stories (Victim, Emotional, and Informational users) to shuffling the site
                content based on the goal of the directors, which is to: push their campaigns, provide access to
                traditional and non-traditional media to their work, and access to their educational tools on
                anti-racism. The old site had a lot of page bloat and was difficult to recall, and the structure
                felt inconsistent. Learning about anti-racism should be a part of everyone’s lifestyle, so I focused
                on making the website as clean, consistent, and accessible as possible - for the boomers, the
                zoomers, the millennials, and hopefully the generations coming. As a result came a site map with a
                few sectional changes.

                <b>Wireframes</b>
                <br><br>
                When it came to developing the wireframes, this brought more understanding to myself and the CCNC-SJ
                team as to what structure works best for the users and for the goals of the directors. Initial
                iterations had a lot less content, limited information on the landing page - solely campaign information
                - as I was focusing on simplicity and access. After the first interation, I learned cleanliness doesn’t
                always equate to access, especially if the purpose of the site is to provide tools and resources to
                encourage anti-racist advocacy.
                <br><br>
                The final product focused on keeping the campaigns and traditional media on the landing page - this is
                to drive their goals for organic campaign engagement and to provide a quick route for traditional media.
                I designed a structure for their campaign pages - #FaceRace and Stop the Spread - so there will be a
                section to house extra information and several sub-pages to be added.
                <br><br>
                Given this site will also house plenty of cited information and curated sources, we added a resources
                page to the global navigation to house links, sources, and partner sections such as the <a
                    href="http://covidracism.ca" class="underline-2">COVID-10 Racism
                    Reporting Tool.</a>

                <b>Visual identity</b>
                <br><br>
                There was no visual expectations for this project besides accessibility and consistency. I wanted to
                establish fresh, bright and neutral palettes, along with UI that felt familiar enough for someone’s
                grandparents to understand the site. The old site had darker tones, a lot of photography, minimal visual
                and text hierarchy, and limited consistency. I opted for placeholders at the top of pages with giant
                headlines in red and black to fill up space and create impact.
                <br><br>
                The organization had no branding or existing design assets, so I tweaked what was already existing to
                fit the new site identity with slight rounded edges and new typefaces - Rubika & Helvetica Neue.
                <br><br>
                <b>Note:</b> all photography is FPO.
