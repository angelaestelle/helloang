NOISE:

Noise Digital
Visual design, UI

In 2017, Noise Digital launched a brand and site refresh. While working with the Art Director, front-end developer, and another designer, I focused on designing, standardizing, and building the case studies page and template on the Noise website.

I initially focused on doing a competitive analysis with other top tier agencies' case studies, and integrating certain elements with the current UX for any existing pages designed for the Noise refresh.

MAURICE MOORE:

Maurice Moore
Creative direction, video, production, design

Since 2014, I've had the honour of working with Maurice Moore as his key creative director on every project. This varies from designing and illustrating cover art, designing merchandise, writing video treatments, creating art direction and shot decks, producing and casting for videos, and outsourcing other creatives, such as videographers and photographers, to execute projects.

A portion of the projects were backed by his team, and another portion was done through his label Empire Distribution.
